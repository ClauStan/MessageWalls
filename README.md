Message Walls=======Simple app where a user can chat with other users by posting text messages on different chat rooms(walls). All posted messages are saved on the server and can be viewed by any user joining the wall on which it was posted. Currently all walls are public and can be joined by any user. A user can join a certain wall only if he knows the walls name.This repository contains:1. Google App Engine server - written in Python2.
